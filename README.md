# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns to determine what benchmarks are vital in a successful campaign. Data from various categories and countries allow us to compare and contrast the different outcomes. Sorting through the dense data to isolate the pertinent theatre data for Louise is the main goal. Through these actions, I hope to provide Louise with useful data-driven information.
## Analysis
The goal for Fever was a positive aspect of the Kickstarter Campaign, as it falls under the average of successful campaign goals. With only 10 backers, this campaign had a very high average donation of $248.50- good work! It seems like your marketing strategies are capturing the appropriate audience; an increase in marketing can help increase the number of backers. The launch date of the campaign was good timing, according to the Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart. If you were to run another campaign, I'd suggest starting the campaign in May, as it yields the highest success rates.
